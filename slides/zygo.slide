* scenario

* Snoopy versus the Red Baron

.image snoopy_ace.png

* What is his cry?

.image curse_you_red_baron.png

- imagine Snoopy comes back with friends...

* data model for a plane formation, Go structs

.code snoopy1

- has Plane as embedded element (we handle these)

* Methods defined on the Snoopy struct

.code snoopy2

- anything that can Fly satisfies the Flyer interface. Weather, informs the Fly event:

.code weather

* Flyer friends, can be listed in the Friends slice in Plane

.code other.planes

* with the data model in mind, lets interact with it using zygo...

* Make it rain

.code make.it.rain

* Bring in some planes, in formation

.code make.planes

- in three lines we've instantiated and configured 3 Go structs in a tree

- call a Go methods on a Go struct... Snoopy goes Fly()-ing

.code plane.interact

* we've just been interacting/scripting Go data and methods...

* yeah, reflection is pretty cool

* zygomys - a scripting toolkit for Go

* zygomys -- what's in a name?

- zygo means union (yoke in Greek; the zygote was the first cell that was you).
- mys means mouse (Greek view of the bicep)
- this is a little mouse of a language
- bonus: a "pocket gopher" known as Zygogeomys trichopus. Our mascot, "Ziggy".
- this is the union of lisp and Go. In a small cute package. 
- Let's agree to use the shorter `"zygo"` for the language when speaking.

The Michoacan pocket gopher is a small animal with short, dense, black, lustrous fur... It is docile when caught, making no attempt to bite as do other pocket gophers.

* Getting started How to embed the REPL in your code

See [[https://github.com/glycerine/zygomys/blob/master/cmd/zygo/main.go]]

.code main.go  /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

that's it.


* overview of design

.image pocket_gopher3.jpeg

- a) lexer produces tokens
- b) parser produces lists and arrays of symbols
- c) macros run at definition type
- d) codegen produces s-expression byte-code
- e) (work in progress) builders create and check types at `run` time. (Builders are a hybrid between a function and a macro.)
- f) a simple virtual machine executes s-expression byte-code. User's functions run.


* Let's see some code

- hashmaps can define arbitrary records; with or without attached Go shadow structs

.code sample.run

* records

- records are hash tables with a name and a key-order

.code harry.record

* plain hash maps, without a record TypeName

.code hash.demo


* arrays (slices)

.code arrays.run



* aims
- interactive, but also aim to eventually compile-down to Go
- blending Go and lisp
- I built it for myself

- technically interesting about the zygo implementation:
- using goroutines as coroutines to get pause-able parsing. avoids the O(n^2) trap. Call for more input from many points; inversion of select loop -- exit when you've got another line of input tokens. See repl/parser.go.
- if you haven't discovered how to do conditional sends on a channel yet, examples inside `github.com/glycerine/zygomys/repl/parser.go`.
   
* hard parts that are already done

- script calls to existing Go functions using existing Go structs. Using reflect is somewhat laborious; but its done
- Go-style for loops, nest-able, with break to label and continue to label.
- eval
- sandbox / restrict filesystem access
- full closures with lexical scope
- adjust lisp syntax to be Go compatible: % for quoting, 'a' for characters.
- higher order functions.

* classic lisp style - list processing

.code hof.foldr

- see the closure tests in [[https://github.com/glycerine/zygomys/blob/master/tests/closure.zy]]

* there is also an infix interface

- anything inside curly braces is infix parsed. Can mix in function calls. Math becomes more readable.

.code infix.session

- uses a top-down operator precedence parser (Pratt parser)

.code infix.txt


* Top-down Operator Precedence (Pratt parsing)

- Like quicksort, Pratt's is a short, sharp algorithm; not particularly easy to understand on the first pass. It builds a parse tree so that precendence is decreasing as you go up to the root. Higher precedence means stronger binding, which means being lower in the parse tree.

- works like magic. Very easy to extend your language with new infix operations, once the core Expression routine is implemented. This is how zygo processes infix syntax.

* zygo use cases

- as a query language
- configuration language that can query itself.
- Eventually... multi-core friendly scripting. (Channels now, but no select yet).
- Eventually... leverage Go's multicore strength for exploratory configuration, data analysis and scripting. (I love R for productivity, Go for production).
 
* the basic Go API: add a zygo method in Go

.code first.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* type system

* type system. work in progress...

- always manifestly typed: a variable points to a value that knows its own type.
- addon: optional static type system -- enforced at definition time -- is half implemented
- to follow status, `github.com/glycerine/zygomys/tests/decl_fun.zy`
- struct declarations done, function type declarations with (func) not yet done.
- the static typing aims for compability with Go types (to enable compile-down)

.code declare.struct

* intro to the mechanism of zygo's static type system: Builders

- A builder is a special kind of function; a hybrdid between a function and a macro. I chose the term `builder` to reflect their ability to build structs (i.e. new types), packages, type aliases.

- Like a macro, a builder receives the un-evaluated parse-tree of symbols from its caller. A builder can therefore be used to build new types and declarations new functions/methods.

- Like a function, a builder is called at run/evaluation time, not at definition time. (Macros are run at code-gen, which is definition time).

- Since it receives an un-evaluated tree of symbols, a builder must manually evaluate any arguments it wishes to find bindings for in scope.

- Used in zygo to define structs. Next planned use: define interfaces, functions, methods, and type aliases. See [[https://github.com/glycerine/zygomys/blob/master/repl/builders.go]] for examples.


* If you want to play with type systems

- try out your parametric-polymorphism idea?
- I don't know if its a good idea but...
- the sigil-system is setup to let you explore this area
- sigil prefixed symbols start with `$`, `#`, or `?`
- makes it easy to define type-variables, for example.


* sigil system

symbols with a special prefix

- `mysym` is a regular symbol
- `$mysym` is a sigil symbol, with sigil '$'. It is distinct from `mysym`.
- `#mysym` is a sigil symbol, with sigil '#'. It is distinct from `$mysym` and `mysym`.
- `?mysym` is a sigil symbol, with sigil '?'. It is distinct from the above.

* sigils part 2

- sigil prefixed-symbols evaluate to themselves by default.
- useful for grammars, symbolic reasoning.


* still todo 2

- dataframe
- matrix / tensor types
- complex number support

* it's the future ... dream big

- model checking syntax and checker (Ordered-Binary-Decision-Diagram based)
- port TLA+ model checker to Go, with zygomys interface
- unification engine for type system experiments
