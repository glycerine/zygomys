* Generate call tree

.code calltree.txt

* maxims

- this is a toolbox (TIAT)
- you have the tools (YHTT)
- Client Before Server (CBS)
- write tests first (a tiny language fragment counts)
- CBS are ways of saying: TDD is the key to evolutionary extensions and sharing. The test suite tells you and others when you've broken earlier/others features; and when you've successfully integated a new feature.

* origins

- I started with Howard Mao's Glisp project.
- Nicely segmented design, good foundation.
- Some of that architecture remains (e.g. name of the env class is *Glisp).
- Many new features (very different syntax and identifiers, Go style comments, true lexical scope, sandboxing, reflection, json/msgpack, record types, etc).
- Very different feel and aims meant a whole new name.
- I encourage you: start with zygomys, make something of your own. 2-clause BSD license.

* non-goals

- this is not a sales pitch for you to "use this product"
- One language to rule them all? Not a goal

// fold: left fold is a classic higher order function
//
//  lst: pair list, the input
//  fun: processes one element in the list
//  acc: the accumulated result, the output
//
(defn foldl [lst fun acc]
    (cond                  // cond is zygo's if-then-else.
        (empty? lst) acc   // return acc if input done.
            (foldl         // else call ourselves recursively.
               (cdr lst)   // cdr extracts the 2nd node from lst.
               fun
               (fun (car lst) acc))  // car extracts the head element
    )
)

* why use an interpreter
- high personal productivity (examples: python, javascript, Matlab, R, Mathematica, lisp, scheme)
- fast feedback
- essential for exploratory data analysis 
- script your game/application
- become a language designer
- DSL creation: model a complex/dynamic problem, configure a complex/dynamic solution
- fun to write
- experiment with design


* side-effects

* perspective on TDD

- test-driven design is incredibly powerful at bringing up cross-layer issues.
- no where more apparent than in a very layered design like an interpreter/compiler. When you make a small language change in the lexer/parser, the test suite will tell what/if you've broken anything else.
- easily one of the most important techniques I've ever learned
- feel like you have super powers

- interpreter work really taught me the power of TDD
- TDD is not a test technique, its an design technique

- "To specify the server, write the client before the server."

* components

- s-expression: lexer and parser
- unification (for type-system and other); this is how parametric polymorphism could be implemented.
- repl. Read-eval-print-loop. an interactive prompt.




* goals: learning and fun

- programming languages are fun!
- Lisp shows us: they don't have to be difficult to write
- particularly great context to learn about Test-driven design
- writing tests is trivial: write little language fragments

* fun

- Great for learning about interpreters, compilers, langauge structure.
- The whole project is a playground for experimentation. Evolve a design.
- I'll show you the architecture; take it and explore, try new stuff.

* overview

- explain overall architecture
- explain how to add a feature
- explain debug tools
- how to see what is happening

* if time

- I'll show the Go API/interface
- how to extend your language with a new function.
- lots of examples on github; the `github.com/gycerine/zygomys/repl/` directory is the central place.
