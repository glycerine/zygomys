// one can define a package directly, like this:
(def hi (package "hello"
   { world := "earth"; (defn myfun [x] (concat world x)) }
))

(assert (== hi.world "earth"))
(assert (== (hi.myfun "yes") "earthyes"))

// or one can define a package by sourcing another file:
{p = (package "doggerel" (source "tests/pkghelp"))}

(assert (== p.a.b 42))
(assert (== p.a.dog "bella"))
(assert (== (p.a.f) 54)) // we can call functions
(assert (== (p.assistor 9) (+ 9 42 3 7))) // functions can refer to package local values and functions
